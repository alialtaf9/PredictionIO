<h1>Welcome to PredictionIO {{ site.pio_version }}</h1>
<p>
PredictionIO is an open source Machine Learning Server. It empowers programmers
and data scientists to build smart applications with data productively.
</p>
<p>
PredictionIO currently offers two engine templates for Apache Spark MLlib:
<ul>
    <li>Collaborative Filtering Engine Template - with MLlib ALS</li>
    <li>Classification Engine Template - with MLlib Naive Bayes</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Take a look at <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/templates/">Engine Templates Quick Start Guide</a>.
</p>
<p>
With these templates, you can create a custom predictive engine for production deployment efficiently:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>predict user behaviors</li>
  <li>offer personalized video, news, deals, ads and job openings</li>
  <li>
    help users to discover interesting events, documents, apps and restaurants
  </li>
  <li>provide impressive match-making services</li>
  <li>and more....</li>
</ul>



<p>
A standard PredictionIO stack is built on top of solid open source technology,
such as Scala, Apache Spark, HBase and Elasticsearch.

<h2>Adding Machine Learning to your web or app quickly</h2>
<h3>For Web and App Developers...</h3>
<p>
PredictionIO comes with a few built-in predictive engines that you can use
out-of-the-box. No Machine Learning knowledge required. You may also customize
them to fit your specific application needs.
</p>
<h3>Learn how to use Built-in Engines</h3>
These few steps can get you familiar with PredictionIO's Built-in Engines
quickily.
<ul>
  <li>
    Read <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/tutorials/engines/quickstart.html">Using Built-in Engines:
    Quick Start</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Learn from some examples in <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/tutorials/engines">Tutorials
    &amp; Samples</a>.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Deploying your own algorithms on production</h2>
<h3>For Data Scientists and Algorithm Developers...</h3>
<p>
If built-in engines don't fit your need, you can also create a new engine and
deploy your own algorithm easily. PredictionIO server handles the heavy-lifting
for production deployment, so that you can focus on your unique prediction
challenges.
</p>
<h3>Learn how to build your own Engine</h3>
These few steps can get you familiar with PredictionIO's Engine buildng process.
